# RISC-V
Building a RISC-V CPU Core
Course Description
This free mini-workshop, offered by by Steve Hoover of Redwood EDA, LLC, Linux Foundation, and RISC-V International is a crash course in digital logic design and basic CPU microarchitecture. Using the Makerchip online integrated development environment (IDE), you’ll implement everything from logic gates to a simple, but complete, RISC-V CPU core. You’ll be amazed by what you can do using freely-available online tools for open-source development. You’ll walk away with fundamental skills for a career in logic design, and you’ll position yourself on the forefront by learning to use the emerging Transaction-Level Verilog language extension (even if you don’t already know Verilog).

This course is available in this repository as well as via the EdX platform (with a certification option). Thousands have registered and/or completed this course, including Claude (Anthropic's AI chatbot):
